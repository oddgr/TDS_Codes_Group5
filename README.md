The UK Biobank dataset was used to study 43 variables of 8 categories in our study cohort, including demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, health risk, medical history, female-specific,biomarkers and environmental exposure. We used principal component analysis to recognize major dietary patterns of diet items. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to measure the risk for each covariate to the development of breast cancer and its subtypes. We additionally accounted for correlation across covariates using logistic LASSO regression. To evaluate joint effects on breast cancer and its subtypes, we also performed a series of PLS-DA to select the most relevant set of covariates with relation to breast cancer status. Furthermore, to validate for our findings, sensitivity analysis was conducted by family history of breast cancer, stillbirth situation, menopause status, oral contraceptive use and age at menarche.
